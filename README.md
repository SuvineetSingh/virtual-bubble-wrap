# Virtual Bubble Wrap

This project is a **Virtual Bubble Wrap** website built using **React**. It allows users to "pop" virtual bubbles and includes a **reset button** to restore the bubbles to their unpopped state.

## Features

- **Bubble Popping**: Click on any bubble to "pop" it. A satisfying sound will play every time a bubble is popped.
- **Reset Functionality**: Easily reset all the popped bubbles with a single click on the reset button.
- **Sound Effects**: Enjoy an audio feedback when you pop each bubble for a more immersive experience.
